#Facebook Messenger App on Desktop

Building using Electron and React with Redux.

I am using Facebook Chat API (Unofficial) since Facebook's Graph API does not allow for direct user access.

The objective of this project is for me to learn React and Redux by attempting to recreate Facebook Messenger's UI with my own interpretation and hopefully have enough space for my own ideas on the app.

## Install
First install with:
```
npm install
```

Then to run the program (development), you will need to run two commands:

To run React:
```
npm start
```

To run Electron:
```
npm run electron
```

Original idea and assets are all from and by Facebook.
